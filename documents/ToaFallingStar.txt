**To a Falling Star**  

Oh fleeting gem of the velvet night,  
A blaze of wonder, swift in flight,  
What dreams you carry, none can know,  
Through endless skies, you come and go.  

Born in the silence of cosmic haze,  
You lived unseen for countless days,  
Now burning bright in your final arc,  
You etch your name upon the dark.  

Do you bring wishes, whispered and small,  
A beacon of hope to answer them all?  
Or are you a tear from heaven’s eye,  
Mourning the vastness of the sky?  

Though brief your dance, your beauty stays,  
A spark to light the soul’s own blaze,  
And as you fade into the deep,  
You leave a promise for hearts to keep.  

So fall, dear star, and grace the night,  
A fleeting gift of endless light,  
For even in your swift descent,  
You remind the world to be content.
